# appiumCICD
This is my first appium project. It is based on Udemy video course.
It supports parallel execution on both iOS and Android devices and can be run via CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins).
The project implements POM design pattern and contains several simple test-cases, performed within the SwagLabs sample app.
There are also logs and screencaps/videos generated, along with the Extent Report html page.
